# Contains

Two parts, one is the header and the other is the side-menu.

## Header

- Logo
- Nav Links
- Hamburger Button

## Sidemenu

- Nav links
- Uses the state menuOpen (boolean) to toggle the sidemenu. This is used on the hamburger menu button and on every link to toggle it off when navigating.

# Further improvements

- [ ] Make the logo an actual logo (SVG or similar instead of text)
- [ ] Make the nav links rendered via a list instead of hardcoding (e.g from an array [Mercury, Venus, Earth ...])
- [ ] Make the menuOpen a toggle function instead of an inline function (makes it more clean)
